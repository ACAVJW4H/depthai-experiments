# CoronaMask

This experiment allows you to run the COVID-19 mask/no-mask object detector which was trained via the Google Colab tutorial [here](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-ml-training/tree/master/colab-notebooks#covid-19-maskno-mask-training-)

Below is a quick run of this mask detector:

You can leverage this notebook ([here](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-ml-training/tree/master/colab-notebooks#covid-19-maskno-mask-training-)) and add your own training images to improve the quality of this mask detector.  Our training was a quick weekend effort at it.
