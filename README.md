# depthai-experiments
Experimental projects we've done with DepthAI.  

**Experiments** can be anything from "here's some code and it works sometimes" to "this is almost a tutorial".  

The following list isn't exhaustive (as we randomly add experiments and we may forget to update this list), but here are some as of June 1st 2020:

## MJPEG and JSON streaming ([here](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments/tree/master/mjpeg-streaming))

This lay the groundwork to make DepthAI [OpenDataCam](https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam) compatible.

## COVID-19 Mask / No-Mask Detector ([here](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments/blob/master/coronamask/README.md))

This project shows you how to run the COVID-19 mask/no-mask object detector which was trained [here](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-ml-training/tree/master/colab-notebooks#covid-19-maskno-mask-training-)

## Social Distancing Example ([here](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments/tree/master/social-distancing))
Since DepthAI gives the full 3D position of objects in physical space, it's a couple lines of code to make a social-distancing monitor with DepthAI.  So that's what this project is, a quick cut at a social-distancing monitor.
