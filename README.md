# depthai-experiments
Experimental projects we've done with DepthAI.  

**Experiments** can be anything from "here's some code and it works sometimes" to "this is almost a tutorial".  

The following list isn't exhaustive (as we randomly add experiments and we may forget to update this list), but here are some as of June 1st 2020:

## - [MJPEG and JSON streaming](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments/tree/master/mjpeg-streaming)

[![MJPEG Streaming DepthAI](https://img.youtube.com/vi/695o0EO1Daw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=695o0EO1Daw "DepthAI on Mac")

This lay the groundwork to make DepthAI [OpenDataCam](https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam) compatible.

The first project is a social-distancing monitor with DepthAI ([here](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments/tree/master/social-distancing)). 
Others include [MJPEG and JSON streaming](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments/tree/master/mjpeg-streaming) which  and a quick example of the COVID-19 mask/no-mask detector which was trained [here](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-ml-training/tree/master/colab-notebooks#covid-19-maskno-mask-training-).
