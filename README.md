# depthai-experiments
Experimental projects we've done with DepthAI.  

**Experiments** can be anything from "here's some code and it works sometimes" to "this is almost a tutorial".  

The first project is a social-distancing monitor with DepthAI ([here](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments/tree/master/social-distancing)). 
Others include [MJPEG and JSON streaming](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments/tree/master/mjpeg-streaming) which lay the groundwork to make DepthAI [OpenDataCam](https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam) compatible, and a quick example of the COVID-19 mask/no-mask detector which was trained [here](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-ml-training/tree/master/colab-notebooks#covid-19-maskno-mask-training-).
